Hello there! Welcome to my profile. I am currently pursuing my Masters degree in Computer Science from <a href="https://www.asu.edu/">Arizona State University</a>. During my time at ASU, I got to work on a variety of projects in domains including Computer Vision, Distributed Databases, Social Analytics, Natural Language Processing. Working on these projects got me interested into research and exploring new fields.

Prior to my masters degree, I worked at <a href="https://www.oracle.com/financial-services/">Oracle Financial Services Software</a> as a Software Engineer for about 2 years, developing branch-side software for India's largest bank, HDFC. 

Through this website, I would like to showcase some of the projects I have worked on and the research I was involved in. Feel free to explore my projects, read through my publications or just get to know a little more about me.

Interested in connecting with me? Reach out at <a href="mailto:hitansh.shah@gmail.com">hitansh.shah@gmail.com</a> or via my <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/hitanshshah/">LinkedIn</a> profile. Thanks for stopping by!
