Namaste! Welcome to my little space on the internet. I am a Computer Science graduate student from <a href="https://www.asu.edu/">Arizona State University</a> currently exploring the applications of computer vision in remote sensing and space exploration. I constantly strive to uncover innovative solutions to complex challenges.

Prior to my masters degree, I began my professional journey as a Software Engineer at Oracle Financial Services Software. To escape the daily grind, I like to immerse myself in the world of online gaming or watching sci-fi movies or shows.

Check out some of my most recent and interesting <a href="/_pages/projects.md">projects</a> and <a href="/_pages/publications.md">research</a> work. Interested in connecting with me? Reach out at <a href="mailto:hitansh.shah@gmail.com">hitansh.shah@gmail.com</a> or via my <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/hitanshshah/">LinkedIn</a> profile. Thanks for stopping by!
